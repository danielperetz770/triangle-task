# README – Triangle with Canvas

Hello, my name is Daniel Peretz.  
I am currently finishing a coding bootcamp at Coding Academy, and I chose to work with their methods because they seem professional and suitable for this project. Of course, I will comply with the company's guidelines in the future if needed.

 1. Drawing Method

I chose to use **Canvas** to draw the triangle for several reasons:

- Allows precise drawing of lines.  
- Provides options for additional design features, like arcs for the triangle angles and text at specific positions.  
- Offers flexibility in design and good performance even for dynamic drawings.

 2. Angle Calculation

Calculating the angles was challenging, especially working with the **law of cosines** and converting the results to degrees.  
To save time and ensure accuracy, I referred to AI for guidance and examples.

 3. Challenges in the Exercise

- **Angle calculation** – the most challenging part, as it required precise math.  
- **Design and element positioning** – aligning the triangle, text, and arcs clearly on the canvas.  
- **Code organization** – keeping separate files and transferring data between pages cleanly.

 4. What Was Achieved

I completed all the requirements of the exercise:

- Input page for entering three points.  
- Display page showing the triangle with marked angles and their values.

 5. External Tools

- I used AI for checking the code, explanations, and angle calculation.  
- Despite this, the code remains simple, clear, and easy to understand.
